TI  - Expansion Characteristics of Stents Used in Congenital Heart Disease: Serial
      Dilation Offers Improved Expansion Potential Compared to Direct Dilation: Results
      from a Pediatric Interventional Cardiology Early Career Society (PICES)
      Investigation.
LID - 10.1111/chd.12399 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intravascular, stents are now routinely used to treat young patients
      with vascular stenoses. Future stent redilations are often necessary to account
      for somatic growth. The purpose of this study was to compile a database of
      characteristics for stents commonly used in the treatment of congenital heart
      disease patients, and compare serial dilation to direct dilation to the maximal
      diameter. DESIGN: A standardized bench testing protocol was established and
      utilized in the assessment of all stents. Ultra high pressure balloons were used
      to serially dilate each stent by set increments until the stent reached at least
      24 mm in diameter, developed a napkin-ring configuration, or fractured. Length
      and diameter of each stent were measured at baseline and following each stage of
      dilation. Maximal stent diameters, foreshortening properties, and ability to
      fracture were reported. Stents were then tested for direct dilation from the
      primary diameter to the maximal diameter, and the same data was obtained.
      RESULTS: A total of 127 stents were bench-tested, 80 of which were serially
      dilated and 47 directly dilated. Most premounted stents could be serially dilated
      to approximately twice their stated nominal diameter. All tested unmounted stents
      could be serially dilated to >/=20 mm. Foreshortening occurred at larger
      diameters, but varied significantly among different stent types. Serial dilation
      offered more consistent results with significantly less foreshortening and more
      symmetric expansion when compared with direct dilation. Most premounted stents
      could be fractured when serially dilated. CONCLUSIONS: All tested vascular stents
      can be dilated beyond their nominal implantation diameter. Serial dilation offers
      a much more reliable response with uniform expansion, less foreshortening,
      greater maximal diameter, and improved intentional fracture potential, as
      compared to direct dilation from the nominal to maximal diameter. In vivo studies
      are necessary to corroborate these findings in the congenital heart disease
      population.
